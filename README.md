## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Mpg Summary Statistics](/images/mpg_linear_regression.png)

H0 : The slope of the linear model is zero, or m = 0
Ha : The slope of the linear model is not zero, or m â‰  0

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The Intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance are unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In other words vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on the mpg.
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model should not be considered zero because the p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35 x 10-11, which is smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficent evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero. 
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
From our linear regression model, the r-squared value is 0.7149, which means that roughly 71% of all mpg predictions will be correct when using this linear model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

### Total Summary
![Total Summary Statistics](/images/total_summary2.png)

For all manufacturing lots in total the variance does not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The summary statistics show the Variance is 62.29 for all manufacturing lots in total.

### Lot Summary
![Lot Summary Statistics](/images/lot_summary2.png)

Lot 1 and 2 have a variance that does not exceed 100 pounds per sqaure inch. Specifically Lot 1 has a variance of 1.0 while lot 2 has a variance of 7.5. Also, Lot 3 does not meet coil variance espectations, their variance is 170.2 which exceeds the 100 pounds variance limit.
